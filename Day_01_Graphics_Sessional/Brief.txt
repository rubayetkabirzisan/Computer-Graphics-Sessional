Installation & Setup Commands
To ensure proper compatibility with the OpenGL + Python environment, make sure your Python version is 3.11 before proceeding.

1. Install PyOpenGL & PyOpenGL_accelerate
pip install PyOpenGL PyOpenGL_accelerate
These libraries provide Python bindings for OpenGL and optional performance acceleration modules.

2. Install GLFW (Option 1)
pip install glfw
GLFW is a lightweight library used to create windows and handle input for OpenGL applications.

3. Install Pygame (Option 2)
pip install pygame
Pygame can also be used to create a display window and manage input for OpenGL rendering.

Python Requirement
✔ Your system must have Python 3.11 installed
You can verify your version using:
python --version
or
python3 --version



Project Brief
3D/2D Design & Animation Module

1. Upcoming Idea Proposal Presentation (Next Week)
Each group will prepare and deliver a presentation outlining their initial project concepts.
1.1 Title Slide Requirements
Include the following details:
•	Project Title
•	Group Member Names
•	Faculty Name

1.2 Idea Proposal Requirements
Present three (3) different project ideas.
Each idea must include:
A. Idea Description
Provide a clear and concise overview covering:
•	Core concept
•	Purpose or objective
•	Unique/important features
B. Demo Image or Video Link
Include any form of visual reference:
•	Sample images
•	Sketches
•	Inspirational artwork
•	Video references (YouTube, Vimeo, etc.)



1.3 Object List
For each proposed idea, provide a brief list of all 3D elements you plan to create, such as:
•	Characters
•	Environment models
•	Props
•	Other relevant assets
This object list will help evaluate scope and feasibility.

2. Lab Overview
2.1 Lab 3
This lab will focus on foundational topics:
•	OpenGL Exam
•	Introduction to Blender
o	Interface and basic workspace navigation
o	Using essential tools
o	Understanding Blender workflow

2.2 Labs 4, 5, and 6
These labs will work exclusively in Blender and cover:
•	Modeling
Creating 3D shapes, characters, objects, landscapes, etc.
•	Rigging
Adding skeletons, controls, and setup for animation.
•	Animation
Creating movement, setting keyframes, building scenes.
 
3. Final Week – Complete Project Presentation
Students will present their fully completed 3D project, demonstrating:
•	Final models
•	Rigging and animation
•	Rendered scenes
•	Workflow and progression
This is the culmination of all lab work and project development.

4. Evaluation & Grading Breakdown
Component	Weightage
3D Project	50–60%
— Proposal	5–10%
— Project Update 1	10%
— Project Update 2	10%
2D Evaluation + Assessment	35%
3D Report + Final Presentation	10%
Observation (Participation & Progress)	5%

Additional Notes
•	Use Blender 2.8x or any updated version.
•	Work must be completed using your own laptop or desktop PC.
